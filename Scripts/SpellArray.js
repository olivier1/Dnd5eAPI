Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to me. The spell lasts for the duration, unless I use my action to dismiss it sooner. The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if I use this spell to add a hat to a creature’s outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature’s head and hair. If I use this spell to appear thinner than I am, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch me would bump into me while it was seemingly still in midair.

The wall can have any shape I desire, though it can’t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, I can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp. If I create a span greater than 20 feet in length, I must halve the size of each panel to create supports. I can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on. The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM’s discretion.

      Description:"This spell instantly transports myself and up to eight willing creatures of my choice that I can see within range, or a single object that I can see within range, to a destination I select. If I target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can’t be held or carried by an unwilling creature. The destination I choose must be known to me, and it must be on the same plane of existence as me. My familiarity with the destination determines whether I arrive there successfully. The DM rolls d100 and consults the table. Familiarity. “Permanent circle” means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence I know. “Associated object” means that I possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard’s library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich’s secret tomb. “Very familiar” is a place I have been very often, a place I have carefully studied, or a place I can see when I cast the spell. “Seen casually” is someplace I have seen more than once but with which I am not very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place I have seen once, possibly using magic. “Description” is a place whose location and appearance I know through someone else’s description, perhaps from a map. “False destination” is a place that doesn’t exist. Perhaps I tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or I am attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists. On Target. Myself and my group (or the target object) appear where I want to. Off Target. Myself and my group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if I tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then I would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If I was teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, I could be in trouble. Similar Area. Myself and my group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If I am heading for my home laboratory, for example, I might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as my laboratory. Generally, I appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, I could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane. Mishap. The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey.

Perhaps I tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or I am attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists. --”On Target”|Myself and my group (or the target object) appear where I want to. --”Off Target”|Myself and my group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if I tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then I would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If I was teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, I could be in trouble. --”Similar Area”|Myself and my group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If I am heading for my home laboratory, for example, I might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as my laboratory. Generally, I appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, I could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane. --”Mishap”|The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where I wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).",

Within the sphere, spells can’t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with me, centered on me. Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can’t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration. Targeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target. Areas of Magic. The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can’t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough. Spells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it. Magic Items. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a non-magical longsword. A magic weapon’s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits. Magical Travel. Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere. Creatures and Objects. A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere. Dispel Magic. Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different antimagic field spells don’t nullify each other.",

The material body I leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn’t need food or air and doesn’t age. My astral body resembles my mortal form in almost every way, replicating my game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between my shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is my tether to my material body. As long as the tether remains intact, I can find my way home. If the cord is cut—something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does—my soul and body are separated, killing me instantly. My astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If I enter a new plane or return to the plane I was on when casting this spell, my body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing me to re-enter my body as I enter the new plane. My astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on my physical body, nor do they persist when I return to it. The spell ends for myself and my companions when I use my action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens. The spell might also end early for myself or one of my companions. A successful dispel magic spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a creature’s original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature’s astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation.

While affected by this spell, the creature doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn’t age. Divination spells can’t locate or perceive the target. When I cast the spell, I choose one of the following forms of imprisonment: Burial. The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it. The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb. Chaining. Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can’t move or be moved by any means until then. The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal. Hedged Prison. The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice. The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade. Minimus Containment. The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can’t be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect. The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby. Slumber. The target falls asleep and can’t be awoken. The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs. Ending the Spell. During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, I can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as I choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points. A dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it. I can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time. If I cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.",
